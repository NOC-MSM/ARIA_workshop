# Introduction to programming in Python

These notebooks are designed as a brief introduction programming in Python.
They are aimed at a novice Python user.
The first notebook covers basic Python usage.
The second covers using the packages `xarray` to open and manipulate geospatial data, and `matplotlib` for plotting data.

They should cover just enough to get you going on the notebooks in the `Challenges/` directory.
