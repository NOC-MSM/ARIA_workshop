    "inflam_001 weight in kilograms: 60.3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also call a function inside of another\n",
    "[function call](learners/reference.md#function-call).\n",
    "For example, Python has a built-in function called `type` that tells you a value's data type:\n",
    "\n",

    "print(type(60.3))\n",
    "print(type(patient_id))\n",

    "\n",

    "Earlier on we just printed text in one print statement, and output\n",
    "in a different print statement. However, in the last example, we printed text and\n",
    "output in the same print statement. Python has several ways to achieve this, we can use a comma seperated list of\n",
    "things to print. Another approach is known as [\"Formatted string literals\"](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#formatted-string-literals),\n",
    "but more commonly called \"f-strings\". We need to prefix the string with the letter 'f', but then\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "print(f'weight in kilograms is now: {weight_kg}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## Variables as Sticky Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable in Python is analogous to a sticky note with a name written on it:\n",
    "assigning a value to a variable is like putting that sticky note on a particular value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this analogy, we can investigate how assigning a value to one variable\n",
    "does **not** change values of other, seemingly related, variables.  For\n",
    "example, let's store the subject's weight in pounds in its own variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# There are 2.2 pounds per kilogram\n",
    "weight_lb = 2.2 * weight_kg\n",
    "print('weight in kilograms:', weight_kg, 'and in pounds:', weight_lb)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```output\n",
    "weight in kilograms: 65.0 and in pounds: 143.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to above, the expression `2.2 * weight_kg` is evaluated to `143.0`,\n",
    "and then this value is assigned to the variable `weight_lb` (i.e. the sticky\n",
    "note `weight_lb` is placed on `143.0`). At this point, each variable is\n",
    "\"stuck\" to completely distinct and unrelated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now change `weight_kg`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "weight_kg = 100.0\n",
    "print('weight in kilograms is now:', weight_kg, 'and weight in pounds is still:', weight_lb)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
